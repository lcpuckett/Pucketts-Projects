# Pucketts-Projects
To Prospective Employers,
Welcome to a small corner of my mind and creativity!
This repo will house some code and projects I'm proud to share. It will be a mix of many things.
I have a Bachelor's of Science in Wildlife Biology and a diploma with hands-on training in Data Science.
My passions related to work incude puzzle- solving and being innovative to better serve a customer or company. 
Outside of work, I love to give my time to animals, im a regular foster with the local animal shelter and adore animals in all forms.
I also enjoy time with my friends and family, maintaining great relationships is important to me and I take pride in being a people-person.
Crafting, music and hobbies are also a big part of my life, i try to stay active and continue to discover all i can about the city i live in at the time. 
I believe it keeps me young and I hope you enjoy what you see!
